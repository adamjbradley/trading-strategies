## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors
```bash
# Missing dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow optuna

# Path issues
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/project"
```

#### 2. Test Timeouts
```bash
# Reduce test data size in setUp methods
# Check system performance
# Run tests individually to isolate issues
```

#### 3. Feature Calculation Errors
```bash
# Check data quality in test setup
# Verify mathematical formulas in feature creation
# Review error handling fallbacks
```

#### 4. Notebook Integration Failures
```bash
# Ensure notebook was properly updated
# Check that enhanced features are in _create_advanced_features method
# Verify imports and dependencies in notebook environment
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose output
python -m unittest -v test_enhanced_features.TestEnhancedFeatures
