## 🚨 Critical Issues Log

### Bug #1: Session Logic Error
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Cell 5, line ~480  
**Impact:** Incorrect forex session detection affects all models
```python
# BROKEN: includes ALL hours 0-23
features['session_asian'] = ((hours >= 21) | (hours <= 6))
```

### Bug #2: Threshold Validation  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Cell 5, line ~215  
**Impact:** Can create negative confidence thresholds
```python
# BROKEN: can result in negative values
params['confidence_threshold_low'] = params['confidence_threshold_high'] - 0.15
```

### Bug #3: Missing Gradient Clipping
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Cell 5, model compilation  
**Impact:** LSTM training unstable, potential crashes

### Bug #4: Memory Management
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Location:** Cell 5, line ~450  
**Impact:** Silent failures, memory leaks

## 🔍 Code Review Notes

### Positive Observations
- Evidence-based hyperparameter ranges (excellent research)
- Domain-specific feature engineering (forex sessions, correlations)
- Quality vs speed trade-off decision in cells 9-11 was correct
- Clean architectural separation of concerns

### Concerns Raised
- Multiple logic errors in core functionality
- Insufficient validation throughout pipeline
