🔧 TO START FULL TRAINING:

Option 1 - Manual Notebook Execution:
1. Open Advanced_Hyperparameter_Optimization_Clean.ipynb
2. Run each cell sequentially (Shift+Enter)
3. When you reach the last cell, it will run all 7 symbols
4. Total time: ~2-3 hours on your GPU

Option 2 - Quick Test:
Run just a few trials per symbol for faster testing

Ready to proceed! 🚀
